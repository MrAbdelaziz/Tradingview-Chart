## Warning

The execution of this code will remove the existing layout and replace it with the cloned layout,
so be sure you don't miss something in the old chart


## Setps

1 - open your chart

2 - click on F12 (or open developer console)

3 - copy the script (script.js) and paste it into the console 

4 - change the __ID_PUBLIC_CHART_ with an id of the layout you want to clone 

5 - Boom! just like that :)
